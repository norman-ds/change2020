<p>A static website written in Hugo ( or e.g. Jekyll, Hexo) is much easier to deploy, than websites that require dynamic server-side languages. All you need is to upload the files to a server, and usually your website will be up and running shortly. One recommend provider, considering the cost and friendliness to starter, could be Netlify (<a href="https://www.netlify.com" class="uri">https://www.netlify.com</a>). Just use your GitHub account to automate the upload process.</p>
<div id="version-control-with-github" class="section level1">
<h1>Version control with GitHub</h1>
<p>Basically, you have to host all source files of your website in a GIT repository. You do not need to put the <code>public/</code> directory under version control because it will be automatically generated. Usually you have some other files that are part of the project (e.g. dockerfile, data, R) but not the website. I recommend to have a file directory <code>download/</code>only for the build process of the static website.</p>

<h1>Deployment with Netlify</h1>
<p>For a new site generated by Netlify, you have to specify a command to build your website, as well as the path of the publish directory. Netlify also supports multiple versions of Hugo, you need to create an environment variable HUGO_VERSION on Netlify. See the Netlify documentation for more information. The publish directory should be public unless you have changed it in your config.toml. Figure 3.1 shows the settings of the website <a href="https://t.yihui.org" class="uri">https://t.yihui.org</a>. You do not have to follow the exact settings for your own website; in particular, you may need to change the value of the environment variable HUGO_VERSION to a recent version of Hugo.36</p>
<p>Netlify is a solution in this chapter that does not require you to prebuild your website. You only need to update the source files, push them to GitHub, and Netlify will build the website for you.</p>
